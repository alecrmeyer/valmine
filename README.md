The goal of this project is to analyze and explore correlations and trends derived from VALORANT match data. There are roughly 1.1 million recorded matches being used for analysis. The code for the webscraper used is in the Web Scraping directory of this project and performs a breadth-first-search approach to adding user matches to a MySQL DB. A mixture of machine learning and exploratory analysis is being conducted on this data.
